This repository contains slides and codes for a tutorial I have given on numerical
continuation for spatially-extended systems, such as PDEs and Integro-differential
equations.

TODO:
* I would like to provide a better example for Travelling Wave continuation. At present there are codes for a neural field travelling wave, using FFTs on a bounded domain. That example is contrived, and this is why I have hidden it in the slides.

* Add examples of a time-periodic structure, and of continuation for time-steppers.
